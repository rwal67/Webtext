          <p>One of these days, I'll go and sit by the docks.</p>
          <p>I'll watch the boats go by.</p>
          <p>I'll go where they're dyed like saffron, mustard, and thyme.</p>
          <p>They'll lend you so many strange questions</p>
          <p>and leave before you answer.</p>
          <p>Like all those sorry things you had:</p>
          <p>the friends</p>
          <p>the trends</p>
          <p>the fears</p>
          <p>and all that you held dear,</p>
          <p>they fade,</p>
          <p>a little at a time.</p>
          <p>Swallowed by a setting sun; they faintly disappear.</p>
          <p>Yes, I'll go to the docks, I'll ask to leave with them</p>
          <p>but they'll be too far to hear.</p>
